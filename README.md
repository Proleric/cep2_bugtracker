CEP 2.x bug tracker

This is the official channel for tracking bugs with CEP 2.x for NWN Diamond and NWN EE.

When filing a bug report please note the version of CEP in the heading using this format: [CEP 2.x]. Next note the NWN version using the same format. So, your heading might look like this:

[CEP 2.65][EE v32] Missing Tile Textures in the CC module "A Dance with Rogues v2.11"

DO NOT REPORT ISSUES FOR CEP 3 OR CEP 1 HERE. They will be closed. 

BEFORE REPORTING, make sure you don't have anything in /override or /development, no Workshop content subscribed to other than CEP, and that you are running the STABLE build of EE.
